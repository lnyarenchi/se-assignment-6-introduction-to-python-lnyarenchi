    3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

      Python program to print "Hello, World!" to the console:

print("Hello, World!")

Explanation of basic syntax elements used:

    print() function: The

    print()

    function is used to display output to the console. In this case, it is used to display the string "Hello, World!".
    String: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. In this case, the string is "Hello, World!".
    Semicolon (;): The semicolon is used to terminate Python statements.


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Basic Data Types in Python:

    Integers (int): Whole numbers, positive or negative.
    Floats (float): Decimal numbers with fractional part.
    Strings (str): Sequences of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
    Lists (list): Ordered collections of elements enclosed in square brackets ([]). Elements can be of any data type.
    Tuples (tuple): Ordered collections of elements enclosed in parentheses (()). Elements are immutable once created.
    Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces ({}).
    Dictionaries (dict): Collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({}), where keys must be unique and values can be of any data type.
    Booleans (bool): Logical values representing True or False.

Python Script Demonstrating Data Types:

# Create variables of different data types
name = "John Doe"  # String
age = 30  # Integer
height = 1.80  # Float
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # List
info = ("John", 30, "engineer")  # Tuple
unique_items = {1, 2, 3, 4}  # Set
student_data = {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}  # Dictionary
is_admin = True  # Boolean

# Print the values of the variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Numbers:", numbers)
print("Info:", info)
print("Unique Items:", unique_items)
print("Student Data:", student_data)
print("Is Admin:", is_admin)

# Add an element to the list
numbers.append(4)
print("Updated Numbers:", numbers)

Output:

Name: John Doe
Age: 30
Height: 1.8
Numbers: [1, 2, 3]
Info: ('John', 30, 'engineer')
Unique Items: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Student Data: {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 25}
Is Admin: True
Updated Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4]


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your code based on specific conditions. The most common conditional statement is the

if-else

statement.

if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False

Example:

number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is non-positive.")

Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The two most common loops in Python are the

for

loop and the

while

loop.

for

Loop

A

for

loop iterates over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, or string.

for element in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each element in the sequence

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)

while

Loop

A

while

loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True.

while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True

Example:

number = 1
while number <= 10:
    print(number)
    number += 1


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Functions in Python

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout a program. They are defined using the

def

keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses for the arguments it takes. The body of the function is indented below the definition.

Benefits of Functions

Functions offer several benefits:

    Code Reusability: Functions allow you to encapsulate code that can be reused in different parts of your program or even in other programs.
    Modularity: By organizing code into functions, you can break down large programs into smaller, manageable chunks, making them easier to understand and maintain.
    Encapsulation: Functions hide the implementation details of a task, allowing other parts of the program to access the functionality without worrying about how it's implemented.

Example Function: Summing Two Numbers

Here's a Python function that takes two arguments,

a

and

b

, and returns their sum:

def sum_numbers(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

Calling the Function

To call a function, simply write its name followed by the arguments it takes. For example, to sum the numbers 5 and 10 using the

sum_numbers

function:

result = sum_numbers(5, 10)
print(result)  # Output: 15

This will call the

sum_numbers

function with

a

as 5 and

b

as 10, and store the result (15) in the

result

variable.


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Lists in Python are ordered, mutable sequences of elements. They can contain any type of data, including other lists, dictionaries, and objects. Lists are created using square brackets ([]), and elements are separated by commas.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']

Dictionaries in Python are unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a single value. Dictionaries are created using curly braces ({}), and key-value pairs are separated by colons (:).

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

Basic Operations on Lists and Dictionaries

Lists:

    Append: Add an element to the end of the list:

my_list.append(4)

    Extend: Add multiple elements to the end of the list:

my_list.extend([5, 6, 7])

    Insert: Insert an element at a specific index:

my_list.insert(2, 'd')

    Remove: Remove an element from the list by value:

my_list.remove('b')

    Pop: Remove an element from the list by index:

my_list.pop(1)

Dictionaries:

    Get: Access a value by key:

name = my_dict['name']

    Set: Set a value for a key:

my_dict['age'] = 31

    Add: Add a new key-value pair:

my_dict['country'] = 'USA'

    Remove: Remove a key-value pair:

del my_dict['age']

    Keys: Return a list of all keys in the dictionary:

keys = list(my_dict.keys())

    Values: Return a list of all values in the dictionary:

values = list(my_dict.values())

Here is a script that demonstrates these operations:

# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Append an element
my_list.append(4)

# Extend the list
my_list.extend([5, 6, 7])

# Insert an element
my_list.insert(2, 'd')

# Remove an element by value
my_list.remove('d')

# Remove an element by index
my_list.pop(1)

# Print the list
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# Create a dictionary
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

# Get a value
name = my_dict['name']

# Set a value
my_dict['age'] = 31

# Add a key-value pair
my_dict['country'] = 'USA'

# Remove a key-value pair
del my_dict['age']

# Print the dictionary
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'country': 'USA'}


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling is a mechanism in Python that allows programmers to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. When an error occurs during the execution of a Python script, an exception is raised. Exception handling allows us to handle these exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user or take appropriate recovery actions.

Using

try

,

except

, and

finally

Blocks

Python provides three blocks that are used for exception handling:

    try

    Block: This block contains the code that may raise an exception.

    except

    Block: This block contains the code that handles the specific exception raised in the

    try

    block.

    finally

    Block: This block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

Example of Exception Handling

Consider the following Python script:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    file = open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r')
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Code to handle the FileNotFoundError exception
    print("The file could not be found.")
finally:
    # Code that is always executed
    print("Cleanup actions performed.")

Explanation:

    In this script, the

    try

    block contains the code that may raise an exception. In this case, the

    open

    function may raise a

    FileNotFoundError

    exception if the specified file does not exist.
    The

    except

    block is used to handle the

    FileNotFoundError

    exception. If the

    FileNotFoundError

    exception is raised, the code in the

    except

    block will be executed. In this case, it prints an error message indicating that the file could not be found.
    The

    finally

    block is used to perform cleanup actions, such as closing the file, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. In this example, the

    finally

    block prints a message indicating that cleanup actions have been performed.

Benefits of Exception Handling:

Exception handling offers the following benefits:

    Error recovery: It allows programmers to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, preventing the script from crashing.
    User-friendly error messages: It provides meaningful error messages to users, helping them understand the problem and take appropriate actions.
    Code maintainability: It helps in organizing and structuring the code, making it easier to manage and maintain.


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules

    Modules are files that contain Python code that can be reused in other Python programs.
    They allow for code organization and encourage code reuse.
    Each module has its own namespace, which is a dictionary-like structure that stores variables, functions, and classes defined in the module.

Packages

    Packages are collections of modules that are logically related.
    They provide a way to organize and namespace modules.
    Packages are stored in directories, where each directory name corresponds to a package name.

Importing Modules

To use a module in your script, you need to import it using the

import

keyword.

Example:

import math

This statement imports the

math

module and makes its contents available in your script.

Using a Module

Once a module is imported, you can access its contents using the module name followed by a dot.

Example:

result = math.sqrt(4)
print(result)

This code uses the

sqrt()

function from the

math

module to calculate the square root of 4.

Importing Specific Functions

You can also import specific functions or classes from a module using the

from

keyword.

Example:

from math import sqrt

This statement imports only the

sqrt()

function from the

math

module.

To use the imported function, use the dot notation as before:

result = sqrt(4)

Importing a Package

To import a package, use the

import

keyword followed by the package name.

Example:

import mypackage

This statement imports the

mypackage

package. To access modules or functions within the package, you need to specify the module or function name after the package name.

Example:

from mypackage import mymodule

This statement imports the

mymodule

module from the

mypackage

package. To use functions or classes from the imported module, use the dot notation as usual:

mymodule.myfunction()


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.


    Reading from a File:

# Open the file in read mode
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the contents of the file
    contents = file.read()

    # Print the contents to the console
    print(contents)

Writing to a File:

# Open the file in write mode
with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write a list of strings to the file
    for line in ['line 1', 'line 2', 'line 3']:
        file.write(line + '\n')
